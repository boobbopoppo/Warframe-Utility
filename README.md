## 📌 Project Overview

This utility automates the process of converting in-game Syndicate standing into Platinum. Instead of manually listing individual mods and updating prices, the script acts as an automated manager that scales item quantities based on your inputted faction balance.

[ Standing Balance ] ──> [ Calculate Inventory ] ──> [ Live Market Ledger ]
(e.g., 100,000)          (100k / 25k = 4 units)         ( Cheaper by 1p )

## 🛠️ Planned Features & Logic

### 1. Manual Ledger Sync
Since Warframe does not provide public APIs for player standing, you manually input your current rank and standing balances into a local config file, which the program uses as its source of truth.

### 2. Automated Undercutting
The engine automatically scans active online sellers for each mod and sets your price to:

$$\text{Your Price} = \text{Cheapest Online Price} - 1\text{p}$$

### 3. Dynamic Quantity Scaling
Your listing quantities are directly tied to your available standing. When you log a sale, the script recalculates your balance and updates all linked mods in that syndicate:

* **Before Sale:** **100,000 standing** with *Steel Meridian* = Lists **4 copies** of every mod.
* **After Sale:** You sell 1 mod, dropping you to **75,000 standing** = Automatically updates all remaining listings to **3 copies**.

### 4. Price Monitor *(Planned)*
A background routine to periodically check if you are being undercut and adjust your active prices to keep your listings competitive.

## 📅 Project Status

This utility is currently in early prototyping. The core logic is undergoing testing, and **there is no current timeline for a stable release.**

What Works For Now:
1) login to your warframe.market account via jwt token. The token needs to be taken from your browser:
   - after loggin in via browser f12 to open inspect view
   - find the storage tab
   - on the left seleect cookies
   - warframe.market
   - there should be only one entry "JWT"
   - copy the value inside the settings.conf file in the root of the project (if the file doesn't exist, create it)
   - now you are logged in 
1) post offer via script
2) post all mods purchaseable via one syndicate (only the six that sell augments for now) in quantity compatible with your standing availability
3) update or delete listing if you sell some or all the mods respectively
4) use web interface to set standing for a syndicate, post all mods for syndicate with the click of a button
5) sell mods for syndicate with the click of other button

## TODO

1) ~~ Web/Gtk interface for ease of use ~~
2)  A serious issue is the limit for listings that warframe.market sets for non-subscribers.
   To solve this issue, I need to post only the (5-10) most traded mods in the last 48 hours, possibly something the user can set for himself
   - The user may not want to sell as fast as possible, but to gain as much platinum per standing as possible. Should implement a function
   that allows the user to choose how much weight it gives to the most traded mods, and how much to the ones that sell for more. 
3) ~~I began to create the web interface, but the logic is wonky, and there are 2 main issues i need to address:~~
   ~~- error in the logic that recomputes the available standing after you sell mods~~
   ~~- the slider doesn't visually update after selling~~
4) more functionalities, like mass post relics, post all relics sold by varzia and whatever comes to mind next
